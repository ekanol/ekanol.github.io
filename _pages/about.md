Hi and welcome to my homepage! I am a social scientist and a postdoctoral research fellow at the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://wzb.eu/en). I served an _interim_ Professor of Sociology at [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/), where I taught Bachelor and Master level classes. 

My research focuses broadly on the topics of radicalization, extremism, prejucide, religious fundamentalism, and social movements. To investigate my research questions, I employ a combination of survey, network, and biographical data analyses, as well as survey experiments. So far, I have worked on three research projects: Monitoring System and Transfer Platform for Radicalization ([MOTRA](https://www.motra.info/)), Jihadi Radicalization in Europe Database ([JRED](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/migration-and-diversity/migration-integration-transnationalization/projects/religious-fundamentalism-and-radicalization-in-comparative-perspective)), Religious Fundamentalism and Radicalization Survey ([RFRS](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/migration-and-diversity/migration-integration-transnationalization/projects/religious-fundamentalism-and-radicalization-in-comparative-perspective)).
