# Course outline
This course is an introductory lecture to the basic concepts and research areas of sociology. Students will explore the ways in which social structures, culture, and institutions shape human behavior, and how individuals and groups interact within these frameworks. The course will begin with an overview of the discipline of sociology and an introduction to sociological methods. Students will learn about the foundational concepts of sociology, including social action, socialization, identity, and social roles. They will also examine the basic problems of sociological theory, including the link between theory and empirical evidence. Students will then explore various aspects of social life, including the nature of communities and societies, the role of social networks, and the importance of cultural norms, values, language, knowledge, and symbols. They will also examine social inequality and its effects on social class, social stratification, and milieu.
Throughout the course, students will examine how power, authority, rule, and discipline shape social relations and institutions. They will also explore how functional differentiation and social integration contribute to the stability of societies and the emergence of social change. The course will culminate in a discussion of the organization, institution, and legitimation of social structures, as well as a preliminary discussion of the essays students will write on a topic of their choosing related to the course material.
Overall, this course will provide students with a broad overview of the fundamental concepts and methods of sociology, and help them develop the skills needed to think critically about the social world around them.
