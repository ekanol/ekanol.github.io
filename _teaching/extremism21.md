# Course outline
In this course, we will discuss various theoretical and empirical approaches to Islamist radicalization and extremism. Our main objective is to deal with the following questions: What are the prominent explanations for the support of radical Islamist attitudes? Which factors contribute to the involvement in radical Islamist behavior? For the purposes of this course, I have categorized the available literature into three broad categories: (1) Psychological, social-psychological explanations, and grievance-based explanations; (2) Social Movement Theories; and (3) religion-based explanations. In each session, we will review theoretical concepts from one line of literature and engage with the relevant empirical perspectives. We will focus on Islamist radicalization both in Muslim-majority countries and among Muslims in the Western European context.
