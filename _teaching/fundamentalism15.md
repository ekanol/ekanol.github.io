# Course outline
In this course we discuss various theoretical and empirical perspectives on Islamic religious fundamentalism, radicalization and political violence, both in Islamic countries and among Muslims of immigrant origin in Western Europe. Religious fundamentalism is not unique to Islam and therefore a comparative perspective is taken that draws on the extensive literature on fundamentalism in Christianity and other religions. Moreover, in order to understand radicalization processes in Islamic movements, comparisons will be made with other forms of political violence.
