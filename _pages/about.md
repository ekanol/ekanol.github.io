Hi and welcome to my homepage! I am a social scientist and a postdoctoral research fellow at the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://wzb.eu/en). Currently, I am an _interim_ Professor of Sociology at [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/), where I teach Bachelor and Master level classes. 

My research focuses broadly on the topics of radicalization, extremism, prejucide, religious fundamentalism, and social movements. To investigate my research questions, I employ a combination of survey, network, and biographical data, as well as survey experiments. Most of my research has so far focused on Jihadi Foreign Fighters.
